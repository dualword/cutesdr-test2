1. Introduction
===============

This is the CuteSDR SE CAT branch: it has been derived from a previous fork that Andrus Aaslaid did from original code in order to support his SDR MK1.5 'Andrus' radio.

The original fork is called CuteSDR 'Special Edition' for SDR MK1.5 'Andrus' Radios and can be found in

    http://code.google.com/p/cutesdr-se/

That development was from CuteSdr 1.05 code created by Moe Wheatley. 
That version incorporates extras to support SDR MK1.5 'Andrus' radios more effectively than a standard version does.

Andrea IW0HDV added support for a minimalistic CAT protocol in order to synchronize Mk1.5 with I0CG SDT 2011 digital transmitter.


The rest of the code base is kept the same way as original, so its functionality for RFSpace radios is intact.
The project is migrated to Visual Studio 2008, but you will need additional tools to be able to build it.



In order to be able to compile the source code on VC2008 the open source version of the Qt, the cross-platform application framework, has to be installed.

Three components need to be installed:

    Qt libraries 4.8.3 for Windows (VS 2008, 234 MB)
    Qt Visual Studio Add-in (does not work with the Express edition) 
    ext 

Check the Qt-Project site for latest versions (http://qt-project.org/downloads). 



2. Build on Linux
=================

First of all, you have to install 

Next we need to setup our environment to the correct location.
If you installed the Qt4 libraries from the standard repositories, qmake should on PATH:

qmake -v
QMake version 2.01a
Using Qt version 4.7.3 in /opt/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/473/gcc/lib

in the case above I was using the following command 

export PATH=/opt/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/473/gcc/bin/:$PATH 

in order to make the Qt available into the current session.


Now we can proceed to build the prerequisite library we need for serial interfaces management:

git clone https://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/
cd qextserialport
qmake qextserialport.pro
make
make install

Please note that, if the "make install" fails with 

Permission denied

error, you have to submit again the command with root privileges (sudo make install).


Next the CuteSDR sources have to be extracted:

svn co https://cutesdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot//cutesdr/branches/iw0hdv/cutesdr-se/
cd cutesdr-se/
qmake CuteSdrSeCat.pro

make

if everything goes well, the executable is found in release subdirectory:

release/CuteSdrSeCat



3. Build on Windows
===================


3.1 Install Visual C++ and Qt libraries
=======================================


Install the free evaluation Visual C++ Express package from Microsoft:

Windows XP:

   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20682

Windows 8:

    http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express


Install the Qt 4.8, accordingly to the compiler above, from:

   http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-vs2008.exe

or

   http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-vs2010.exe



3.2 Install WinSvn
==================

Download and install WinSVN:

https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/win32svn/1.7.8/apache22/Setup-Subversion-1.7.8.msi


3.3 Change the environment
==========================

Next we need to modify the environment for the current user, in order to find Qt utilities and libraries

setx QTDIR   C:\Qt\4.8.4\
setx QTPATH  C:\Qt\4.8.4\bin
setx PATH    "%QTPATH%;%PATH%"

In Windows XP setx command is not available so, you have to access the the 
My Computer context menu, Properties and, from there, in TAB "Advanced", 
press the button "Environment Variables": now add the two env vars above to 
the USER environment ("New" push button).


3.4 Extract and build qextserialport library
============================================

Download it at 

http://qextserialport.googlecode.com/files/qextserialport-1.2rc.zip

unzip it in your home directory, e.g. C:\Users\andrew\qextserialport-1.2rc .
Next open the shell you find in Visual C++ menu, and submit the following commands:

cd %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\qextserialport-1.2rc
qmake
nmake
nmake install


3.5 Extract and build CuteSDR SE
================================

Open a shell, go into a convenient directory (in Windows7/8 the user home)
I strongly suggested, "%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%" e.g. C:\Users\andrew) and submit the following commands:

cd %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%
svn co https://cutesdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cutesdr/branches/iw0hdv/cutesdr-se  
cd cutesdr-se
qmake CuteSdrSeCat.pro
nmake debug
nmake release

In order to compile using the VC++ GUI, create the project file for VC++:

cd %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\cutesdr-se
qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc CuteSdrSeCat.pro

next open the project file and press F7 in order to build the program.
