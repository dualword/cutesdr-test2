Sdr IQ Server

0. Introduction
===============

This program attempt to mimic the sdrxx server created by Moe WHEATLEY in order to
provide SDR-IQ with a network interface compatible with that of more sophisticated radio
from RFSPACE.
Alas the sdrxx server source code resulted unfeasible to port to Linux, but was invaluable 
as reference for write

A special mention deservers Ken N9VV that put his radio, Linux computer and Internet connection
to my disposal in order to develop and test this software.



1. Build
========

In order to compile this program and CuteSDR, you need to install the libftdi support and cmake:

sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev cmake subversion  # Debian /Ubuntu
sudo rpm install libftdi-devel cmake subversion    # RH/Fedora/OpenSuse

After that you can extract the 

svn co https://cutesdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cutesdr/branches/iw0hdv/linux/trunk/ cutesdr-lx

Next compile with the following command:

cd cutesdr-lx
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4
sudo make install


2. Run
======

In order to run CuteSDR you have to remove from your system the standard Linux kernel FTDI driver;
this is feasible at run time:

sudo rmmod usbserial ftdi_sio

Next check that the radio is correctly linked to the system:

lsusb

....
Bus 006 Device 002: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC
....

If everything is fine, open a terminal window and start the server:

siqs
------ 
------ SDR-IQ server for Cute SDR
------ 
------ libftdi version
------ 
------ (C) 2012, Ken N9VV && Andrea IW0HDV

interfaces = 2:
lo - 127.0.0.1
eth0 - 192.168.10.1
SRXXX STARTED: size 56
Press q <ENTER> to exit.
Listening for TCP connections on port 50000 socket: 6


Last, run CuteSDR from another terminal window, and into the menu Setup->Network press "Find SDR" push button
or manually insert the network data.
The auto discovery proceudre works only if the CuteSDR and the server are placed
on the same LAN (broadcast domain).

Please not that the server is not yet completed with all the features: e.g. the discovery 
messages is only partially supported.
